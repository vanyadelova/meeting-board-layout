# ðŸ“… Meeting board ðŸ“…
## [DEMO](https://meetings-board.netlify.app/)

## What this project is about
This is my own attempt at the Progress' task. The goal of this task is to create pure CSS layout for a screen. The app should include the following features:

- **Left hand side is for appointments**
- **Right hand side shows current time and icons for meeting related tasks**
- **On the bottom left there is a volume slider**
- **Layout that can be viewed on a variety of devices**
- **Working code**
- **Readme**


## Run it locally ðŸ–¥

Clone the repository.
```
$ git clone git@github.com:vanyadelova/meeting-board-layout.git
```
Start the app.

```
cd meeting-board-layout
firefox index.html || chrome index.html
```
